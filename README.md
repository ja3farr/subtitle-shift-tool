# subtitle-shift-tool
A simple Python tool to delay or advance subtitle (.srt) files using Jupyter Notebook
# 🎬 Subtitle Shift Tool (Jupyter Notebook)

A Python notebook that shifts `.srt` subtitle files forward or backward in time by a user-defined number of seconds.

## 🧠 Features
- Shifts subtitle timing by any amount (positive or negative)
- Simple logic using string parsing and time manipulation
- Run inside Jupyter — easy and beginner-friendly

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- datetime, file I/O

## 📁 How to Use
1. Upload your `.srt` file to the same folder as the notebook.
2. Set the shift value in **milliseconds** (e.g., `+2500` for a 2.5-second delay, or `-1750` to make subtitles appear 1.75 seconds earlier).
3. Run all cells — the notebook will create a new subtitle file with shifted timing.
